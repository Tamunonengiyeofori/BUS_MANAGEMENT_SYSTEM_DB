# Bus Management System Database

Welcome to the Bus Management System Database repository! This project is designed to manage a comprehensive database for a bus network, including bus companies, routes, bus stops, passengers, buses, trips, tickets, and a ticketing app.

## Project Overview

- **Design and Implementation**: We have meticulously designed and implemented a robust database system to efficiently handle all aspects of a bus network.

- **Entity-Relationship Diagram**: To visualize the complex relationships between various entities and key constraints, we've created a comprehensive entity-relationship diagram.

- **Relational Schemas**: Our models have been expertly translated into relational schemas, and the database system has been effectively implemented using SQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j.

- **Testing**: We believe in the importance of reliability. That's why we've developed thorough test cases to query the database system in SQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j. These tests ensure the data outputs are accurate and dependable.

## Technologies Used

- SQL: For structured data storage and retrieval.
- MongoDB: For flexible, document-based data storage.
- Neo4j: For graph-based data storage and querying.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the required database systems (SQL, MongoDB, and Neo4j).
3. Execute the database setup scripts to create the schema.
4. Run the test cases to ensure the database functions correctly.

Feel free to explore the code and the database schema. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.
